<title>Google Sued in Europe for $2.4 Billion in Damages Over Shopping Antitrust Case</title>

<description>Google is being sued in Europe on competition grounds by price comparison service PriceRunner which is seeking at least ~$2.4 billion in damages. From a report: The lawsuit accuses Google of continuing to breach a 2017 European Commission antitrust enforcement order against Google Shopping. As well as fining Google what was -- at the time -- a record-breaking antitrust penalty (2.42 billion euro), the EU's competition division ordered the search giant to cease illegal behaviors, after finding it Google giving prominent placement to its own shopping comparison service while simultaneously demoting rivals in organic search results. Immediately following the order, Google made some initial tweaks to how its product search service works -- doubling down on an auction model. But complainants were instantly critical of the changes, arguing they neither remedied the unfairness nor complied with the EU's requirement for equal treatment of price comparison services. The following year, an investigation by Sky News also accused Google of trying to circumvent the EU antitrust ruling by offering incentives to ad agencies to create faux comparison sites filled with ads for their clients' products which Google could display in the Google Shopping box to present the impression of a thriving marketplace for price comparison services.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>FCC's 'Rip and Replace' for ZTE and Huawei Balloons To $5.6B</title>

<description>Today, Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel notified Congress that providers have initially requested approximately $5.6 billion from the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program to cover the costs of removing, replacing, and disposing of insecure equipment and services in U.S. networks. From a report: "Last year Congress created a first-of-its kind program for the FCC to reimburse service providers for their efforts to increase the security of our nations communications networks," said Chairwoman Rosenworcel. "We've received over 181 applications from carriers who have developed plans to remove and replace equipment in their networks that pose a national security threat. While we have more work to do to review these applications, I look forward to working with Congress to ensure that there is enough funding available for this program to advance Congress's security goals and ensure that the U.S. will continue to lead the way on 5G security."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Mark Zuckerberg and Team Considering Shutting Down Facebook and Instagram in Europe if Meta Cannot Process Europeans' Data on US Servers</title>

<description>An anonymous reader shares a report: If Meta is not given the option to transfer, store and process data from its European users on US-based servers, Facebook and Instagram may be shut down across Europe, the social media giants' owner reportedly warned in its annual report. The key issue for Meta is transatlantic data transfers, regulated via the so-called Privacy Shield and other model agreements that Meta uses or used to store data from European users on American servers. The current agreements to enable data transfers are currently under heavy scrutiny in the EU. In its annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Meta warns that if a new framework is not adopted and the company is no longer allowed to use the current model agreements "or alternatives," the company will "probably" no longer be able to offer many of its "most significant products and services," including Facebook and Instagram, in the EU, according to various media reports, including in iTWire, The Guardian newspaper and Side Line Magazine. 

Sharing data between countries and regions is crucial for the provision of its services and targeted advertising, Meta stressed. Therefore, it previously used the transatlantic data transfer framework called Privacy Shield as the legal basis to carry out those data transfers. However, this treaty was annulled by the European Court of Justice in July 2020, because of data protection violations. Since then, the EU and the US did stress they are working on a new or updated version of the treaty.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Troubled Toshiba To Split Into Two Firms Instead of Three</title>

<description>Toshiba said it would divide into two companies and sell non-core assets, scrapping an initial three-way split that faced fierce criticism from activist shareholders. From a report: The Japanese tech giant plans to spin off the devices business, which includes semiconductors, and list it, Toshiba said in a statement Monday in Tokyo. It scrapped an earlier plan to separate out its infrastructure operations, which will instead continue to come under Toshiba. Splitting into two companies would be cheaper and smoother than the original plan, it said. Toshiba also designated Toshiba Tec, its listed electronic equipment business, as a non-core business, it said, though it stopped short of saying it would sell the unit. The company will also use 300 billion yen ($2.6 billion) of excess capital for shareholder returns over two years, it said. Shares of memory-chip business Kioxia Holdings will continue to be held by Toshiba, it said, but the firm will seek to monetize the shares "immediately" and return proceeds to shareholders. Kioxia has been pursuing an initial public offering, but has also been reported to be in talks to merge with Western Digital.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>After Banks Froze Their Accounts, Some Adult Entertainers Turned to Cryptocurrencies</title>
<link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/22/02/07/020253/after-banks-froze-their-accounts-some-adult-entertainers-turned-to-cryptocurrencies?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
<description>CNBC interviewed six adult entertainers about cryptocurrency use, including webcam performer Allie Eve Knox, who became interested in cryptocurrencies after "several vendors, including PayPal, Square Cash, and Venmo, shut down her accounts because of red flags related to sex work."
[T]he biggest attraction was having total and irreversible ownership over the money she had earned. "I could cash it out. I could hold it. I could watch it go up and down," said Knox. "It was mine." Knox is one of many adult workers who say that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin give them a sense of security and independence as banks, credit card companies, and payment processors tighten regulations around adult content. With crypto, there is no middleman making a judgment call on which transactions are acceptable.... 

"The majority of sex work in the U.S. is legal. It's not dealt with fairly, but it's still legal," explained Kristen DiAngelo, an activist and Sacramento-based sex worker who has spent over four decades in the industry.... Some escorts &amp;mdash; who charge anywhere from $1,700 an hour to $11,000 for a full 24 hours &amp;mdash; now explicitly say in their ads that they prefer to be paid in bitcoin or ethereum.... DiAngelo tells CNBC she will never forget the first time her bank account was closed without warning.... DiAngelo called Citibank and learned that her account had been frozen and she should tear up her credit card. DiAngelo says the customer service rep told her that they weren't "at liberty" to tell her why it had happened, and she would have to write a formal letter to request additional details. 

They did, however, say that she was still responsible for any money owed.... There was particular irony in her situation, as DiAngelo did a stint as a stockbroker at Citibank in the 1980&amp;#226;s, always pays her taxes, and has a credit score over 800.... [S]he brought her money to another bank. When they also flagged and closed her account, she moved on to the next. After being shut out of a third bank, DiAngelo says she turned exclusively to bitcoin for her online banking needs. Nearly every sex worker interviewed for this story mentioned platform hopping.... 

Nowadays, it's par for the course to see adult websites accept cryptocurrency, and some deal in it exclusively... Some adult media companies have even turned to blockchain technology to develop their own digital currencies and platforms.... 

Sex workers who do accept crypto also have to contend with volatile prices, which can cut into their earnings. For instance, bitcoin is down more than 40% from its November all-time high. 

Knox also tells CNBC she's sold photos of herself as NFTs on sites like OpenSea. "Thus far, the most she's gotten from a single sale is $1,200 worth of ethereum."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<description>"Subaru and Kia dealers in Massachusetts have disabled systems that allow remote starts and send maintenance alerts..." reports Wired. 
Subaru buyers in Massachusetts also lose access to the telematics system's app, so "no emergency assistance; no automated messages when the tire pressure was low or the oil needed changing."

Subaru disabled the telematics system and associated features on new cars registered in Massachusetts last year as part of a spat over a right-to-repair ballot measure approved, overwhelmingly, by the state's voters in 2020. The measure, which has been held up in the courts, required automakers to give car owners and independent mechanics more access to data about the car's internal systems. But the "open data platform" envisioned by the law doesn't exist yet, and automakers have filed suit to prevent the initiative from taking effect. So first Subaru and then Kia turned off their telematics systems on their newest cars in Massachusetts.... "This was not to comply with the law &amp;mdash; compliance with the law at this time is impossible &amp;mdash; but rather to avoid violating it," Dominick Infante, a spokesperson for Subaru, wrote in a statement. Kia did not respond to a request for comment. 

The dispute is the latest chapter in long-running disagreements between the state and automakers over the right to repair, or consumers' ability to fix their own cars or control who does it for them.... [N]ew vehicles are now computers on wheels, gathering an estimated 25 gigabytes per hour of driving data &amp;mdash; the equivalent of five HD movies. Automakers say that lots of this information isn't useful to them and is discarded. But some &amp;mdash; a vehicle's location, how specific components are operating at a given moment &amp;mdash; is anonymized and sent to the manufacturers.... These days, much of the data is transmitted wirelessly. So independent mechanics and right-to-repair proponents worry that automakers will stop sending vital repair information to the diagnostic ports. That would hamper the independents and lock customers into relationships with dealerships.... 

Automakers say opening the car's mechanical data to anyone would be dangerous &amp;mdash; and a violation of federal law. In November 2020, just after voters approved the ballot measure, a trade group that represents most major automakers sued Massachusetts in federal court. The group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, argued that the federal government, not states, should control who gets access to cars' telematics systems. The group also said that it would be irresponsible and dangerous to create the open data platform that the law required, especially by 2022.... 

Dealerships are caught in the middle. It's an especially unfortunate time to be there, given the chip shortage that has curtailed vehicle production &amp;mdash; and sales.
 
One dealer reportedly even asked a potential car buyer, "Don't you have any friends in Rhode Island whose address you can use?"&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Original 'Fight Club' Ending Restored in China After Censorship Backlash</title>
<link>https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/22/02/07/0452215/original-fight-club-ending-restored-in-china-after-censorship-backlash?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
<description>Last month streamers in China discovered that Fight Club had arrived on streaming platform Tencent &amp;mdash; but with an entirely new ending where local authorities "rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals....." 

But now there's been another round of changes, according to the Hollywood Reporter. "After widespread online backlash to clumsy censorship of the film's ending, Chinese streaming service Tencent Video backtracked in recent days and restored most of the cuts it had made."
Crucially, Fight Club's complete ending is now viewable in full in China... 

News of the cuts went viral around the world and sparked much debate and embarrassment on Chinese social media about local censorship practices.... [I]t would appear that the backlash has been deemed more troublesome than the fictional film's ending, as Tencent has now restored 11 of the 12 minutes it originally cut from the 137-minute movie. The minute still missing is mostly comprised of brief nude sex scenes between Brad Pitt's and Helena Bonham Carter's characters. 

Insider reports that changing the original ending provoked comments like these on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo: 


- "This has become a Chinese-only joke. Even dogs won't want to watch this." 

- "This is exactly why, even if you have streaming platform subscriptions, you still have to watch pirated versions." 

And it brought massive attention to China's history of changing movies, notes the Wrap since "word quickly spread across the globe, bringing embarrassment to the country," reports the Wrap:
Censorship of American films and TV shows at the behest of Chinese officials has become common as Hollywood has made in-roads in the country over the past decade. Last year, an episode of "The Simpsons" in which the titular family visits China was removed from Disney+ in Hong Kong over a joke made in the film about the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and the Chinese government's censorship of the event. 
Even the South China Morning Post reported that Chuck Palahniuk, the author of the novel that inspired the film, "appeared to mock the move on Twitter. 'Everyone gets a happy ending in China!' he wrote..."
Similar changes have been made to other films in China in the past. Nicolas Cage's 2005 crime film Lord of War had its final half-hour cut and replaced with text reading, "Yuri Orlov confessed all the crimes officially charged against him in court and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the end." 

And another example from the Hollywood Reporter:
After 20th Century Fox's Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody won multiple Oscars in the 2018, it was granted a theatrical release in China &amp;mdash; but only after all mentions of Freddie Mercury's homosexuality were cut from the film. 

But in this case a global popular outcry appears to have been too embarrasing to endure. According to the Hollywood Reporter now we even have an expected ending to the story of how China tried to censor Fight Club. 

"Reversals of censorship actions are extremely rare within China's entertainment industry &amp;mdash; but cuts to Hollywood movies are not."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Can Mapping Differences in Cancer Rates Help Pinpoint Environmental Factors?</title>
<link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/22/02/07/014242/can-mapping-differences-in-cancer-rates-help-pinpoint-environmental-factors?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
<description>"Scientists have made the first steps to develop an atlas of world cancer, hoping it will bring us closer to a cure," reports the Telegraph. 

"A map showing stark differences in the incidence of 10 types of cancer between Spain and Portugal has sparked a race to pinpoint causes and risk factors people should avoid."

It shows huge differences for people living only a short distance apart, sometimes across the border between Spain and Portugal, and others occurring within the same country. Scientists say it will take years to solve the puzzle completely but are confident that the map provides the pieces. There are easier questions and more complex riddles. But it all points to environmental factors &amp;mdash; as opposed to genetics &amp;mdash; playing a major role in causing cancers. 

The lung cancer map tells a clear story of far higher levels of smoking tobacco in Spain than in Portugal, with the latter country showing a consistent hue of dark blue for a lower risk of mortality, while Spain has large areas lit up in red, at least on the map representing men. Twenty per cent of Spanish adults are daily smokers, compared with just over 11 per cent in Portugal. But the data from cancer of the larynx, also linked to smoking, tells a vastly different story, with a high mortality risk for men shown straddling the border in southern Portugal and south western Spain, as well as patches in the north of both countries. "The lung cancer and smoking connection is very clear, so why in other cancers that have a strong link with tobacco are we seeing such surprising differences?" asks Pablo Fern&amp;aacute;ndez-Navarro, the lead co-ordinator of the atlas from the Spanish side. 

"This is what is so fantastic. If whole countries had uniform levels of mortality, the maps would be in plain colours. Given that it is not the case, now we have to investigate and explain these differences, eliminating one factor after another," Fern&amp;aacute;ndez-Navarro told The Telegraph. 

In the case of larynx cancer, the Spanish epidemiologist says the map confirms that smoking is by no means the only risk factor, and that other elements must also be at work, from alcohol intake to levels of pollutants such as asbestos or petrochemicals in the environment.

<title>North Korea Stole Millions in Cryptocurrency to Fund Its Missile Program, Says UN Report</title>

<description>North Korea funded its missile programs with millions of dollars in stolen cryptocurrency, reports the BBC, citing a new UN report:

Between 2020 and mid-2021 cyber-attackers stole more than $50m (&amp;pound;37m) of digital assets, investigators found. Such attacks are an "important revenue source" for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programme, they said. The findings were reportedly handed to the UN's sanctions committee on Friday. 

The cyber-attacks targeted at least three cryptocurrency exchanges in North America, Europe and Asia. 

The report also referenced a study published last month by the security firm Chainalysis that suggested North Korean cyberattacks could have netted as much as $400m worth of digital assets last year. And in 2019, the UN reported that North Korea had accumulated an estimated $2bn for its weapons of mass destruction programmes by using sophisticated cyber-attacks.... 

The US said on Friday that North Korea &amp;mdash; formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) &amp;mdash; carried out nine missile tests last month alone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Meta Threatens To Pull Facebook and Instagram From Europe If It Can't Target Ads</title>
<link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/02/06/2313240/meta-threatens-to-pull-facebook-and-instagram-from-europe-if-it-cant-target-ads?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
<description>"Facebook is threatening it will simply pull out of Europe altogether if it is no longer able to share data about European users with its U.S. operations, applications, and data centres," reports ITWire. 

It's customary for regulatory filings to preemptively declare a wide variety of possible future hazards, and in that spirit a recently-filed Meta financial statement cites a ruling by the EU's Court of Justice (in July of 2020) voiding a U.S. law called the Privacy Shield (which Meta calls one legal basis for its current dara-transferring practices). Though courts are now determining the ruling's ramifications, ITWire notes that "with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) well in force, the U.S. Privacy Shield principles were found non-compliant and consequently invalid." So while that ruling affects every American company, including cloud companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, it's Facebook/Meta that "says stopping transatlantic data transfers will have a devastating impact on its targeted online advertisements capabilities." 

Read it yourself, in Meta's own words:
 
"If a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on Standard Contractual Clauses [now also subject to new judical scrutiny] or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations." 

Of course, the filing also cites other hazards like the possibility of new legislation restricting Facebook's ability to collect data about minors, complaining that such legislation "may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions." 

And in addition, "We are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, and competition..." 

"Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business."

<title>A Month After Ransomware Attack, Hundreds of Workers Are Still Owed Pay</title>
<link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/22/02/06/2130233/a-month-after-ransomware-attack-hundreds-of-workers-are-still-owed-pay?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
<description>NBC News tells the story of Rich, a Coca-Cola delivery driver who didn't get a paycheck at Christmas because of a ransomware attack on the payroll company serving Coke's largest distributor. 

But then "more than a month after hackers crippled Kronos," paychecks to its employees in Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia "have been sporadic, according to union representatives."

Rich, who asked not to be identified by his last name for fear of retaliation from his employer, is among hundreds of workers who deliver Coke products in at least three states who say they're still owed wages &amp;mdash; fallout from one of the many ransomware attacks that hit U.S. companies practically every day. Rich, a father of three, said he's had to dip into his savings, which have dwindled down in recent weeks. "They went from $1,100, $1,200 a week to $300, $600," he said of his paychecks. "I got one $300 paycheck, and I called and told them exactly what I needed paid, and they sent me a $46 check...." 

"We've got 130 people and they've all got problems," said Max Zemla, the president of the Cleveland-area Teamsters Local 293. "Some are telling me they're not as bad off. I have a guy who's off a thousand dollars. Uses his money for his kid's tuition for school, and he's not able to pay it...." 


"The timekeeping vendor Kronos that suffered the attack is in the process of coming back online," [said Josh Gelinas, Coca-Cola Consolidated's vice president of communications February 1st] in an emailed statement. "But, until these digital systems are fully restored, we must continue manually recording work hours for thousands of our teammates. This process is taking longer than we would like and may have resulted in some inconsistencies, but our teammates will be paid for every hour they've worked...." 

[NBC reports that a spokesperson for Kronos "noted that the company announced on Jan. 22 that it had finally restored all its services."] 
Jeff Combs, the secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 135 in Indianapolis, said the vast majority of the roughly 200 Coca-Cola Consolidated employees he represents are still owed pay. "Some are still owed as high as $4,700," Combs said. 
Rich complains to NBC News that "now my savings have dwindled down because a billion-dollar company can't give you an average paycheck." But it shows ransomware's effects ultimately reach farther than we realize. "It's often assumed that ransomware mainly affects governments and major corporations because it's those incidents that make the news," a ransomware analyst at Emsisoft tells NBC News. 

"The reality, however, is that more than half of all ransomware victims are small businesses and individuals. And, unfortunately, they are usually not as well prepared to deal with the problem as larger organizations and probably feel more pain as a result."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Washington Post Editors:  America's IRS Shouldn't Make You Scan Your Face</title>
<link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/22/02/06/2044224/washington-post-editors-americas-irs-shouldnt-make-you-scan-your-face?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
<description>The Washington Post's editorial board announces its position in "The Post's view," a section of its site which officially "represent the views of The Washington Post as an institution, as determined through debate among members of the Editorial Board." Its newest position? 
America's Internal Revenue Service "should not make you scan your face to see your tax returns."

The Internal Revenue Service might soon force every American who wants to access their taxes online to record a selfie of themselves and submit to facial recognition to verify their identity. The IRS wants to start this extra verification procedure this summer. That would be a mistake. This cannot be the only way to access an account online, as 90 percent of tax filers currently do. 

Requiring facial recognition could prevent a substantial number of people from accessing their accounts. Low-income Americans often lack the necessary technology, and research shows people of color are more likely to be misidentified. There are equally serious concerns about privacy and what will happen to the potentially more than 100 million selfies the IRS will collect. Cutting down on fraud is a worthy goal, but facial recognition should not be introduced so swiftly without clear guardrails around the data.... [T]here is no federal law regulating how this sensitive information can be used. And let's not forget that hackers exposed the personal information of more than 140 million Americans when they broke into Equifax &amp;mdash; itself once an IRS verification company.... 

There have been encouraging reports that the IRS is reconsidering its sole reliance on ID.me for online verification for website access. At a minimum, the IRS must offer other verification options and clearly articulate guidelines on what happens to all facial data.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>GTA Metaverse?  Rockstar Confirms 'GTA 6' Is In Active Production</title>
<link>https://games.slashdot.org/story/22/02/06/2017227/gta-metaverse-rockstar-confirms-gta-6-is-in-active-production?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
<description>Rockstar Games recently acknowledged the "unprecedented longevity" of Grand Theft Auto V (and its online component Grand Theft Auto Online) &amp;mdash; and confirmed their working on the next new game for the series. 

But Forbes argues "The success of GTA Online itself may end up fundamentally changing the way Rockstar makes this series going forward..."

The success of Grand Theft Auto 5 has been both a blessing and a curse. A blessing for Rockstar, making zillions from the success of GTA Online, and for those deeply invested in that world which has continually gotten new expansions and additions. But a curse for those waiting for GTA 6, as Rockstar is now about to release GTA 5 across three different generations, cementing its massive lead as the best-selling game in history, endlessly delaying a true sequel. Now, however, Rockstar has finally stated the obvious, they are working on the next GTA game, which we're all calling GTA 6, but Rockstar stops short of saying number that outright.... 

 I don't know if we can say for sure if this is going to be GTA 6 specifically, either the name or the concept.... I can imagine a "new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series" being a massive game that is perhaps online from the start, including for its base campaign. And not to use the "m" word, but there are less compelling metaverses than what GTA Online has become, and Rockstar may want to lean into that even further to try to get ahead of competition trying to make their own virtual worlds. As such, I could see a future that blends a traditional numbered GTA sequel and GTA Online, and who knows what that would be called ("GTA World?" "GTA Infinite?"). Just saying, it may not be "GTA 6," exactly.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>What Would Happens To Meta and Google If Privacy Invasion Were Criminalized?</title>
<link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/02/06/0228218/what-would-happens-to-meta-and-google-if-privacy-invasion-were-criminalized?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
<description>Apple's privacy push could cost Meta $10 billion in lost 2022 advertising revenue &amp;mdash; and that news alone erased $250 billion in Meta's value, notes long-time Slashdot reader theodp. 

But this leads them to a thought experiment: What would happen to Meta's and Google's business models if the privacy invasion behind the companies' lucrative advertising model were actually criminalized?

While there would likely still be the same massive demand for the free services provided by Meta and Google, being unable to target customers of interest to advertisers based on snooped behaviors and demographics seems likely to throw the duopoly's lucrative cost-per-click (CPC) and cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) advertising model that powers these free services into disarray. 

So what might the end game look like for Facebook and Google in a Web world where privacy was enforced by law? One imagines the pair could try to incur the additional cost of delivering many times more untargeted impressions in an effort to reach the same number of behavior and demographic-targeted impressions desired by advertisers, assuming they could get that to work and gain advertisers' trust in the new model. But one wonders if advertisers might start diverting more ad dollars away from Meta and Google to other sources such as media providers, whose varied content naturally segments audiences and could deliver greater assurance to advertisers that more relevant viewers are being reached. Might Meta and Google pivot to become syndicators of media content and be forced to share more of the advertising loot? 

And what about the Metaverse &amp;mdash; could Meta-sponsored events and interest groups hosted there provide Meta with opportunities to naturally segment its massive user base into areas that could facilitate targeting audiences relevant to advertisers even without privacy invasion? 

Finally &amp;mdash; if worse comes to worst &amp;mdash; would users actually pay to use Meta's and Google's services if the new advertising model failed to deliver sufficient revenue to keep services free?&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Algorithms, Copyrights, or Clueless Industry Executives:  What's Killing New Music?</title>
<link>https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/22/02/06/1730225/algorithms-copyrights-or-clueless-industry-executives-whats-killing-new-music?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
<description>"Old songs now represent 70 percent of the U.S. music market, according to the latest numbers from MRC Data, a music-analytics firm." So writes Ted Gioia, author of the Substack music/pop culture newsletter "The Honest Broker". But it gets worse: "The new-music market is actually shrinking. All the growth in the market is coming from old songs. The 200 most popular new tracks now regularly account for less than 5 percent of total streams. That rate was twice as high just three years ago....." 

The signs are everywhere &amp;mdash; including the fact that viewership for the music industry's Grammy awards plummeted 53% this year to just 8.8 million. "More people pay attention to streams of video games on Twitch (which now gets 30 million daily visitors)." 

And even then, "When a new song overcomes these obstacles and actually becomes a hit, the risk of copyright lawsuits is greater than ever before.... Adding to the nightmare, dead musicians are now coming back to life in virtual form &amp;mdash; via holograms and 'deepfake' music &amp;mdash; making it all the harder for young, living artists to compete in the marketplace." 

But in the end the real problem may ultimately be that "nothing is less interesting to music executives than a completely radical new kind of music."

Who can blame them for feeling this way? The radio stations will play only songs that fit the dominant formulas, which haven't changed much in decades. The algorithms curating so much of our new music are even worse. Music algorithms are designed to be feedback loops, ensuring that the promoted new songs are virtually identical to your favorite old songs. Anything that genuinely breaks the mold is excluded from consideration almost as a rule. That's actually how the current system has been designed to work. 
Even the music genres famous for shaking up the world &amp;mdash; rock or jazz or hip-hop &amp;mdash; face this same deadening industry mindset. I love jazz, but many of the radio stations focused on that genre play songs that sound almost the same as what they featured 10 or 20 years ago. In many instances, they actually are the same songs. 

This state of affairs is not inevitable. A lot of musicians around the world &amp;mdash; especially in Los Angeles and London &amp;mdash; are conducting a bold dialogue between jazz and other contemporary styles. They are even bringing jazz back as dance music. But the songs they release sound dangerously different from older jazz, and are thus excluded from many radio stations for that same reason. The very boldness with which they embrace the future becomes the reason they get rejected by the gatekeepers. A country record needs to sound a certain way to get played on most country radio stations or playlists, and the sound those DJs and algorithms are looking for dates back to the prior century. And don't even get me started on the classical-music industry, which works hard to avoid showcasing the creativity of the current generation. We are living in an amazing era of classical composition, with one tiny problem: The institutions controlling the genre don't want you to hear it. 
The problem isn't a lack of good new music. It's an institutional failure to discover and nurture it. 
So while the author acknowledges that "The fear of copyright lawsuits has made many in the industry deathly afraid of listening to unsolicited demo recordings," far deeper than that is the problem that, "The people running the music industry have lost confidence in new music." 
Yet if there's any hope, the author argues, it's that people "crave something that sounds fresh and exciting and different.... Songs can go viral nowadays without the entertainment industry even noticing until it has already happened. That will be how this story ends: not with the marginalization of new music, but with something radical emerging from an unexpected place...." 

"The CEOs are the last to know. That's what gives me solace.... The decision makers controlling our music institutions have lost the thread. We're lucky that the music is too powerful for them to kill."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;
